# lightning [![Go](https://github.com/chfanghr/lightning/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chfanghr/lightning/actions/workflows/go.yml)

This is a ***WIP*** project.

The purpose of this project is to forward messages between a `qq` group and a `telegram` group.

## Getting Started

1. Fill the configuration file, save it as `config.json`.
    - Please refer to [`config.json.example`](config.json.example).
    - Redis configuration can be ignored if you use `docker-compose` to deploy this project.
2. Run `docker-compose build`
3. Run `docker-compose up -d`
4. Run `docker-compose logs -f` if you use qr code to log in to qq
5. Enjoy!

## Features

- [x] Forward text messages
- [x] Forward images
- [x] Recall messages from both `telegram` and `qq`
- [x] Forward telegram static stickers(including `gif`s)
- [x] Forward telegram tgs/animated stickers

## Troubleshooting

* The program always fails to send (text) messages to qq:
    - remove `session.token` and `device.json` in the `userdata` folder
    - restart services using `docker-compose restart`
    - log in to `qq` (if needed) again
